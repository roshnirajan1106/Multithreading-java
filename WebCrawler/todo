A web crawler is a program that systematically browses the web to extract information from websites. It starts with a seed URL, downloads the page content, extracts links from that page, and then follows those links to discover and process more pages. It's commonly used for search engine indexing, data mining, web scraping, and site monitoring.

Core Steps for Implementation
1. URL Management

Maintain a queue of URLs to visit (frontier)
Keep track of visited URLs to avoid duplicates
Handle URL normalization and validation

2. HTTP Request Handling
Send GET requests to fetch web pages
Handle HTTP responses, redirects, and error codes
Respect rate limiting and politeness policies

3. Content Processing

Parse HTML content to extract data
Extract links from pages for further crawling
Filter and validate extracted URLs

4. Concurrency with ExecutorService

Use thread pools to crawl multiple pages simultaneously
Manage thread-safe data structures for URL queues
Control crawling rate to avoid overwhelming servers
5. Storage and Output

Store extracted data (database, files, etc.)
Log crawling progress and errors

Key Dependencies You'll Need
Essential Libraries:

<!-- HTTP Client -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>

Built-in Java Components:

ExecutorService and ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrency
ConcurrentHashMap and BlockingQueue for thread-safe collections
URL and URI classes for URL handling

Optional but Helpful:

Logging framework (SLF4J + Logback)
JSON processing library if working with APIs
Database driver if persisting data


Architecture Overview
Your main components will be:

CrawlerEngine: Orchestrates the crawling process
URLFrontier: Manages the queue of URLs to visit
WebPageFetcher: Handles HTTP requests using ExecutorService
ContentProcessor: Parses HTML and extracts links/data
RobotsTxtChecker: Respects robots.txt rules
RateLimiter: Controls request frequency per domain

The ExecutorService will manage a pool of worker threads that continuously fetch URLs from the frontier, process the content, and add newly discovered URLs back to the queue.
